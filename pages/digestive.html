        The <strong>digestive system</strong> is made up of the gastrointestinal
        tract—also called the GI tract or digestive tract—and the liver,
        pancreas, and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs
        joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The hollow
        organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach,
        small intestine, large intestine, and anus. The liver, pancreas, and
        gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system. The small
        intestine has three parts. The first part is called the duodenum. The
        jejunum is in the middle and the ileum is at the end. The large
        intestine includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum. The appendix
        is a finger-shaped pouch attached to the cecum. The cecum is the first
        part of the large intestine. The colon is next. The rectum is the end of
        the large intestine.
