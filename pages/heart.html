          Your heart is located between your lungs in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone (sternum).
          A double-layered membrane called the pericardium surrounds your heart like a sac.
          The outer layer of the pericardium surrounds the roots of your heart's major blood vessels and is attached by ligaments to your spinal column,
          diaphragm, and other parts of your body
          The heart weighs between 7 and 15 ounces (200 to 425 grams) and is a little larger than the size of your fist. By the end of a long life, a person’s
          heart may have beat (expanded and contracted) more than 3.5 billion times. In fact, each day, the average heart beats 100,000 times, pumping about 2,000 gallons (7,571 liters) of blood.

  <div class="p1-container">
      <p class="p1">Four valves regulate blood flow through your heart:
          The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle.
          The pulmonary valve controls blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen.
          The mitral valve lets oxygen-rich blood from your lungs pass from the left atrium into the left ventricle.
          The aortic valve opens the way for oxygen-rich blood to pass from the left ventricle into the aorta, your body’s largest artery.</p>

      <h4 class="h4">The Conduction System</h4>
  </div>
  
  <div class="p2-container">
      <p class="p2">
          Electrical impulses from your heart muscle (the myocardium) cause your heart to contract.
          This electrical signal begins in the sinoatrial (SA) node, located at the top of the right atrium.
          The SA node is sometimes called the heart’s “natural pacemaker.” An electrical impulse from this natural pacemaker travels through the muscle fibers of the atria and ventricles, causing them to contract.
          Although the SA node sends electrical impulses at a certain rate, your heart rate may still change depending on physical demands, stress, or hormonal factors.

      <p class="p3">
          The heart and circulatory system make up your cardiovascular system.
          Your heart works as a pump that pushes blood to the organs, tissues, and cells of your body.
          Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to every cell and removes the carbon dioxide and waste products made by those cells.
          Blood is carried from your heart to the rest of your body through a complex network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries.
          Blood is returned to your heart through venules and veins. If all the vessels of this network in your body were laid end-to-end,
          they would extend for about 60,000 miles (more than 96,500 kilometers),
          which is far enough to circle the earth more than twice!

      <h6 class="h6">Chambers</h6>
  </div>
  
  <div class="p4-container">
      <p class="p4">
          The heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers.
          The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum.
          This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage,
          or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart.
          Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum,
          visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.
          The fibrous cardiac skeleton gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum,
          which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings,
          which serve as bases for the four heart valves.
          The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity.
          The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles.
          The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract

  <div class="p5-container">
      <p class="p5">
      Heart conditions are among the most common types of disorders. 
      In the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death.
  
      Common conditions that affect your heart include:
  
      Arrhythmia: A heartbeat that s too fast, too slow or beats with an irregular rhythm.
      Cardiomyopathy: Unusual thickening, enlargement or stiffening of your heart muscle.
      Congestive heart failure: Your heart is too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood throughout your body.
      Coronary artery disease: Plaque buildup that leads to narrow coronary arteries.
      Diabetes: Your blood sugar is higher than it should be.
      Heart attack (myocardial infarction): A sudden coronary artery blockage that cuts off oxygen to part of your heart muscle.
      Heart valve disease: A valve in your heart isn t working right.
      High blood pressure: Your blood is pushing too hard against your artery walls.
      High cholesterol: Your blood has too many fats in it.
      Pericarditis: Inflammation in your heart s lining (pericardium).
